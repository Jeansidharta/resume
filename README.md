# Resume

This is my personal resume. It's made using just react. To export it as PDF, simply run the program and print the HTML page.

A deployed version of this can be found here: https://jeansidhartaresume.netlify.com/

The choice to make a web-based resume comes from my anger towards tradicional PDF writting tools, where you have little control over the end product. As a result, I chose to write this in React to allow for more flexibility. Also, the fact that I can easily deploy this is neat.

# How to run

$ npm install
$ npm start
